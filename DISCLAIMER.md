## Purpose
This project provides **research and educational** tooling for privacy-preserving audiovisual metrology and historico-forensic analysis.

## No legal or medical advice / Not a medical or safety-critical device
Nothing in this repository constitutes **legal advice** or **medical advice**. 
The toolkit and any reference hardware are **not medical devices**

## Regulatory compliance
Operators are responsible for complying with applicable laws and policies (e.g., consent, data-protection, workplace/tenant notification, signage, retention).

## Calibration & measurement uncertainty
Reported metrics depend on **sensor quality, calibration, setup, and context**. Treat outputs with appropriate **uncertainty bounds**. Verify with **certified reference instruments** and competent personnel.

## Privacy & human subjects
The design processes **descriptors only** (no intelligible content), but operators must still implement **data minimization, consent, signage, opt-out, retention, and access controls** consistent with local law and institutional policy.
If your work involves people, obtain the necessary **IRB/REC approvals** and follow human-subjects protections. **This project does not endorse harmful exposure protocols**, it's quite the antithesis and kind of the entire point of this project.
