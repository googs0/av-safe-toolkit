# Threat Model (MVP)
* **Assets:** minute summaries, hash chain, signatures, report integrity.  
* **Adversaries:** local tamper, spoofing uploads, weak time sync, variance and deviation 
* **Mitigations:** hash chaining, signature verification, secure time source (RTC), WALâ€‘mode SQLite, audit logs.
* **Out of scope (MVP):** strong hardware TEEs, remote attestation, coercive deployments (see [Acceptable Use](ACCEPTABLE_USE.md)).
