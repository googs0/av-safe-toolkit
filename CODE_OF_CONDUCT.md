- Give and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Show empathy toward other community members
- Prioritize privacy and safety

### Unacceptable behavior
- Harassment, discrimination, or derogatory comments in any form.

## Enforcement responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code of Conduct. They may remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope
This Code of conduct applies within all project spaces and also applies when an individual is representing the project in public spaces (e.g., using an official account or acting as a maintainer). It does not act as a replacement, but rather works alonside and with the [ACCEPTABLE_USE.md](ACCEPTABLE_USE.md).

## Reporting
Report violations to **av-safe-info@proton.me**.  
Include: a description of the incident, where it occurred (links if possible), and any relevant context. Reports will be reviewed by maintainers listed in [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md).

## Enforcement guidelines
Maintainers will follow these community-impact guidelines in determining appropriate actions. Appeals may be sent to **av-safe-info@proton.me** and will be reviewed by maintainers not involved in the original decision whenever possible.

## Integration with acceptable use & safety
- This project **must not** be used to surveil, target, discipline, or coerce individuals
- Do not request or share raw recordings, PII, or secret material
- Violations of [ACCEPTABLE_USE.md](ACCEPTABLE_USE.md) may result in bans
