# Acceptable Use (Anti‑Surveillance)

You may **not** use this project to surveil, target, or discipline individuals; to conduct coercion; or to store raw audio/video. Deploy with signage and opt‑out where applicable.

### Purpose & scope: 
This policy sets the ethical and operational boundaries for using the AV-SAFE toolkit, reference hardware, and HF-AVC corpus (“the Project”). It complements (but does not replace) the software license. By using the Project, you agree to abide by this policy in addition to the LICENSE and the Code of Conduct.

### 1) Prohibited uses 
You may not use the Project to: 
- Surveil, target, or discipline individuals (e.g., workplace monitoring, tenant/student discipline, algorithmic management).
- Support detention, interrogation, intelligence, or law-enforcement operations, including in carceral, military, or policing contexts.
- Coerce or harm (e.g., induce sleep loss, distress, or sensory overload; recreate harmful exposures).
- Capture, transmit, or store raw intelligible content (speech, images, or video) using this software or derivative hardware.
- Fingerprint or track individuals via acoustic or photometric signatures.
- Bypass consent, signage, or transparency obligations; or to violate privacy/data-protection laws.
\
**There are no exceptions to the above**

### 2) Sensitive settings (expressly disallowed unless given direct authorization)
- Detention/prison, border facilities, police stations, military or intelligence sites
- Workplaces for performance/discipline, dormitories or residential institutions used for control
- Medical/clinical settings for non-consensual monitoring

### 3) Permitted uses (examples)
- Research & education within IRB/REC or equivalent ethics oversight, using descriptors-only pipelines.
- Architectural, occupational, and public-health audits of rooms and buildings for compliance with WHO noise and IEEE-1789 flicker guidance.
- Rights-oriented monitoring by ombuds/inspectors where deployments meet the requirements below and avoid prohibited contexts.

### 4) Deployment requirements
All deployments must meet these conditions:
- **Descriptors only:** no raw audio/video capture or retention. Store minute-level descriptors and integrity hashes/signatures only
- **Transparency:** visible signage and a plain-language notice describing what is measured, why, for how long, and who to contact
- **Consent:** obtain consent where required by law or policy; provide a meaningful opt-out
- **Data minimization:** collect the minimum necessary; define retention periods and delete on schedule
- **Security:** protect keys, use TLS for transport, restrict access, and keep audit logs; never commit private keys to source control
- **Calibration & uncertainty:** maintain calibration logs; state uncertainty; verify results with reference instruments when material
- **Chain of custody:** preserve hash-chain continuity and timestamps in reports

### 5) Human-subjects & safety
- No harmful exposures, sleep-deprivation protocols, hazardous flicker under **ANY** circumstances
- Any study with people requires prior ethics approval (IRB/REC) and trauma-informed procedures

### 6) Legal compliance
- You are responsible for complying with applicable law

### 7) Reporting suspected misuse
